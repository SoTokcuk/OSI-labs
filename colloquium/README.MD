In this code, we create factory objects for breakfast and lunch, and then use them to create an order at the restaurant. We order two dishes: the first is breakfast with cheese, the second is lunch with a double portion of vegetables. We use decorators to add cheese and vegetables.

Then we output the name and price of the ordered dishes and free up the memory allocated to those dishes and factories.
